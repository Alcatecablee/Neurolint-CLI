## [1.5.5] - 2025-12-13

### Fixed

#### Official Codemods Integration - Corrected Command Syntax

Fixed the official codemods integration to use the correct, working command syntax:

**React 19 Codemods (Corrected):**
- Now uses `npx codemod@latest react/19/<transform> --target <path>` (recommended by React team)
- Previously used non-existent `@react-codemod/*` packages that would fail

**Codemods now integrated:**
- `react/19/replace-reactdom-render` - Converts ReactDOM.render() to createRoot()
- `react/19/replace-string-ref` - Converts string refs to callback refs
- `react/19/replace-act-import` - Updates act import from react-dom/test-utils
- `react/19/replace-use-form-state` - Replaces useFormState with useActionState

**Next.js 15 Codemods (New):**
- `next-async-request-api` - Makes cookies(), headers(), params async
- `next-request-geo-ip` - Migrates geo/ip to @vercel/functions
- `app-dir-runtime-config-experimental-edge` - Changes experimental-edge to edge

**Next.js 16 Codemods (Updated):**
- `remove-experimental-ppr` - Removes experimental_ppr Route Segment Config
- `remove-unstable-prefix` - Removes unstable_ prefix from stabilized APIs
- `middleware-to-proxy` - Migrates middleware convention to proxy

**Security Fix:**
- Added path escaping in shell commands to handle spaces and special characters safely

### Changed
- Updated `docs/OFFICIAL-CODEMODS-INTEGRATION.md` with correct command syntax
- Updated tests to validate correct codemod CLI usage
- Node.js requirement updated from 16+ to 18+ for codemod support

## [1.5.4] - 2025-12-13

### Added

#### Official Codemods Integration

New `--with-official-codemods` flag for `migrate-react19` and `migrate-nextjs-16` commands enables a two-phase migration:

- Handles 50+ additional fixes that official codemods don't cover

**Features:**
- Graceful degradation if npx not available
- Non-blocking errors (logs and continues)
- Dry-run support (shows what would run without executing)
- Detailed Phase 1/Phase 2 summary in output

**Usage:**
```bash
neurolint migrate-react19 . --with-official-codemods --verbose
neurolint migrate-nextjs-16 . --with-official-codemods --dry-run
```

**Documentation:**

#### Layer 8 Security Forensics v2.3.0 - New CVE Detection

Layer 8 has been updated to detect two new React Server Components vulnerabilities disclosed today:

**CVE-2025-55184 (Denial of Service, CVSS 7.5)**
- Malicious request can cause infinite loop during server-side deserialization
- Added 5 new IoC signatures (IOC-081 to IOC-085):
  - Server action infinite loop patterns
  - Recursive self-call detection
  - setImmediate/queueMicrotask/nextTick loop detection
  - RSC payload replay loop patterns
  - Flight protocol deserialization attack surface detection

**CVE-2025-55183 (Source Code Exposure, CVSS 5.3)**
- Malicious request can leak server function source code including hardcoded secrets
- Added 5 new IoC signatures (IOC-086 to IOC-090):
  - Server function toString() exposure
  - Function stringification patterns
  - Hardcoded secrets in server actions
  - Database connection string exposure
  - Error handler source code leaks

**New Behavioral Patterns (BEHAV-028 to BEHAV-032)**
- AST-based detection of infinite loops in server contexts
- Recursive scheduling patterns (setImmediate, queueMicrotask, nextTick)
- Function.toString() exposure in server actions
- Response data containing source code or stack traces

**Enhanced Dependency Assurance**
- Now detects "partially patched" versions (19.0.1, 19.1.2, 19.2.1)
- These versions patched CVE-2025-55182 (RCE) but remain vulnerable to DoS and source exposure
- Fully patched versions: 19.0.2, 19.1.3, 19.2.2

**Verified Numbers**
- 90 total IoC signatures (up from 80)
- 32 behavioral patterns (up from 27)
- 137 passing tests

### Changed
- Version bumped to 1.5.3
- Layer 8 version bumped to 2.3.0

## [1.5.2] - 2025-12-10

### Added

#### CLI Output Improvements
- **Centralized output utility**: Created `shared-core/cli-output.js` with TTY detection, NO_COLOR/CI env support, and consistent severity-to-stream routing
- **Colorized spinner**: Updated `simple-ora.js` to use colors when TTY detected, text-based symbols ([OK], [ERROR], [WARN], [INFO]) for accessibility
- **Proper stderr routing**: Errors and warnings now consistently route to stderr across all CLI components
- **Actionable hints**: Added HINTS map in CLIReporter for severity-specific and category-specific guidance
- **No emojis**: All output uses text-based symbols per user preference
- **TTY-aware colors**: Colors automatically disabled in CI environments or when output is piped

### Changed
- Version bumped to 1.5.2

## [1.5.1] - 2025-12-09

### Added

#### Documentation Expansion
- **20+ new documentation pages**: Created comprehensive docs matching Supabase/Vercel enterprise quality
- **Dark minimalist theme**: Pure black (#000000) backgrounds, zinc-900/zinc-800 surfaces, white text, zinc-800 borders only
- **NO colorful icons**: Removed all emoji-style icons per user preference
- **Command pages**: analyze, fix, migrate-react19, migrate-nextjs-16 with full flag documentation
- **Layer pages**: All 8 layers with real CLI names (Configuration, Patterns, Components, Hydration, Next.js, Testing, Adaptive, Security Forensics)
- **Security pages**: CVE-2025-55182, IoC Detection, Incident Response workflows
- **Guide pages**: CI/CD Integration, Backup & Restore, Troubleshooting
- **Technical pages**: How It Works, AST Transformations with architecture details
- **Sidebar navigation**: All pages accessible via collapsible sidebar sections

#### npm Publishing Preparation
- **package.json cleanup**: Moved frontend-only dependencies to devDependencies
- **engines field**: Updated minimum Node.js version from >=16.0.0 to >=18.0.0 for glob@12 compatibility
- **Lean production dependencies**: CLI now only requires @babel/generator, @babel/parser, @babel/traverse, @babel/types, and glob for runtime

#### Documentation Accuracy Audit
- **Fixed fake layer names**: Replaced ConfigMaster, PatternCleanse, ReactRepair, HydraFix, NextGuard, TestReady, AdaptiveLearn with real CLI names
- **Verified CLI reference**: DocsCliReference.tsx layers output now matches actual `neurolint layers` command
- **Fixed scroll-to-top navigation**: Added useEffect in DocsLayout.tsx to scroll to top on page changes

#### Pre-Publishing Security Audit Fixes
- **CLI handleLayers command**: Added Layer 8 (Security Forensics) to the layers listing - previously only showed 7 layers
- **LandingFeatures.tsx**: Updated from 6 to 8 layers with correct descriptions
- **UI Components**: Created missing components (badge.tsx, button.tsx, glowing-border.tsx)
- **Marketing copy**: Updated "All 6 code-fixing layers" to "All 8 code-fixing layers"

### Fixed

#### Layer 7 Production-Grade Fixes
- **Fixed**: Overly broad `/^/` pattern in `extractPatterns()` that matched everything
  - Now only creates 'use client' patterns for files with actual React hooks (`hasReactHooks`, `hasClientImports` checks)
- **Fixed**: `this` context issue in `executeLayers()` causing `this.backupManager` to be undefined
  - Changed from `this.backupManager` to local `backupManager` instance variables
- **Fixed**: Dry-run mode returning original code instead of transformed code
  - Now returns `updatedCode` so callers can inspect simulated mutations
- **Fixed**: Suggestions inflating `changeCount` metric
  - Suggestions now tracked separately and don't increment transformation counts

### Added
- Verbose error logging in Layer 7 catch blocks (enabled via `NEUROLINT_DEBUG='true'`)
- 41 comprehensive unit tests for Layer 7 in `__tests__/fix-layer-7-adaptive.test.js`
  - RuleStore persistence tests
  - Transform flow tests (including dry-run, suggestions, normalization)
  - Pattern extraction tests with overly broad pattern validation
  - Security pattern extraction tests

### Changed
- Version bumped to 1.5.1

## [1.5.0] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed

#### Layer 8 Performance & Windows Compatibility (Critical)
- **Fixed**: Commands `security:scan-compromise` and `security:incident-response` hanging/timing out
- **Root Cause**: Behavioral analyzer was attempting to parse JSON files with Babel's JavaScript parser
- **Solution**: Added JSON file detection to skip AST parsing (JSON is still scanned via regex signatures)

#### Cross-Platform Path Exclusion
- **Fixed**: Exclusion patterns like `**/.neurolint/**` not working on Windows or for root-level directories
- **Improved**: Pattern matching now extracts core directory names and checks path segments directly
- **Added**: Path normalization for Windows backslash compatibility

### Changed
- Bumped version to 1.5.0

## [1.4.11] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed

#### Pattern Matching Bug (Windows + Root-Level Paths)
- **Critical**: Fixed glob pattern matching for `.neurolint/` and `.neurolint-backups/` exclusions
- Dots in patterns like `.neurolint` were not escaped, causing regex to match any character
- Root-level paths (e.g., `.neurolint/states.json`) weren't matched by `**/.neurolint/**` pattern
- Added proper regex escaping and root-level pattern fallback

## [1.4.10] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed

#### Windows Compatibility Bug
- **Critical**: Fixed path separator issue causing `node_modules` to be scanned on Windows
- Windows uses `\` but exclusion patterns use `/`, causing 6,645 files to be scanned instead of ~12
- Added `.replace(/\\/g, '/')` to normalize paths before exclusion matching

#### Additional Exclusions
- Added `.neurolint/**` to default exclusions (internal state files)
- Added `.neurolint-backups/**` to default exclusions (backup files)

## [1.4.9] - 2025-12-08

### Added

#### React 19 Security Patterns (BEHAV-023 to BEHAV-027)

Added 5 new behavioral analysis patterns specifically targeting React 19 security vulnerabilities:

| Signature | Name | Severity | Detection |
|-----------|------|----------|-----------|
| BEHAV-023 | React 19 use() with User Input | High | Detects user-controlled URLs in use(fetch()) calls |
| BEHAV-024 | useActionState with Code Execution | Critical | Detects eval/exec/spawn in action handlers |
| BEHAV-025 | useOptimistic XSS Risk | High | Detects innerHTML/dangerouslySetInnerHTML in optimistic updates |
| BEHAV-026 | startTransition Data Leak | High | Detects potential data exfiltration in transitions |
| BEHAV-027 | Server Cache Poisoning Risk | High | Detects caching of user-specific sensitive data |

**Technical Implementation:**
- AST-based detection with nested property traversal (not string matching)
- `getRootObject()` walks MemberExpression chains to find root identifiers
- `hasUserInputProperty()` collects property names and checks for tainted sources
- Only flags known user-controlled sources: req/request/context with query/body/params

**Test Coverage:**
- 5 comprehensive tests for BEHAV-023 (2 positive, 3 negative)
- Negative tests ensure "never break code" principle: static URLs, URL objects, database queries
- Test suite expanded to 132 tests (all passing)

### Changed
- Version bumped to 1.4.9

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-08

### Added

#### Layer 8 Security Hardening

**ReDoS Protection:**
- Added SafeRegex utility with pattern pre-validation to prevent catastrophic backtracking
- Patterns automatically simplified to safer alternatives when dangerous structures detected
- Input chunking for large files to prevent memory exhaustion

**Error Handling:**
- Replaced silent error suppression with ErrorAggregator for proper error tracking
- Per-file error tracking with phase and context information
- Errors cleared between scans for accurate per-file diagnostics

**Memory Management:**
- BehavioralAnalyzer.cleanup() clears currentCode after analysis
- resetForNewScan() methods on all analyzers for proper state cleanup
- Memory monitoring with automatic backpressure during large scans

**New CVE-2025-55182 Signatures (IOC-071 to IOC-080):**
- IOC-071: Server action WebSocket exfiltration
- IOC-072: Server action WebSocket C2 channel
- IOC-073: Malicious service worker registration
- IOC-074: Service worker fetch interception to IP
- IOC-075: PWA manifest tampering with IP
- IOC-076: PWA manifest malicious scope
- IOC-077: Server action response caching attack
- IOC-078: Server action streaming attack
- IOC-079: Server action FormData injection
- IOC-080: Server action bind exploitation

**Other Improvements:**
- Windows path compatibility with normalizePath()
- PathPattern checking for IOC-024
- Rate limiting for large scans
- Base64 threshold increased to 500+ chars to reduce false positives

### Changed
- IoC signature count expanded from 70 to 80
- Test suite expanded from 114 to 127 tests
- Version bumped to 2.1.0

## [1.5.0] - 2025-12-07
